Thank you for considering helping with the Journey project!
At the moment, there is still a lot changing in the plugin and adding more developers right now
would not be very effective.

However, we are looking for feedback! We encourage you to download the plugin and get a feel for it.
We are eager for any suggestions! Examples of topics include:
- Command structure
- External plugin support (Essentials, Towny, RPG servers, etc.)
